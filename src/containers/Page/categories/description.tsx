                        <p className="cle-designer-desc">Some fashion designers will forever be remembered for how they pushed
                            boundaries and influenced how we all dress. From Coco Chanel's famous skirted suits to Alexander McQueen's
                            out-of-the-box creations, these designers all stand out in history as masters of taste and creativity.
                            Fashion designers hold a special place in our world. Their talent and vision play a big role in how people
                            look, and also contribute to the cultural and social environment. They love to study fashion trends,
                            sketch designs, select materials, and have a part in all the production aspects of their designs. They
                            contribute to the creation of millions, if not billions of pieces of clothing and accessories purchased by
                            consumers on a yearly basis.</p>
